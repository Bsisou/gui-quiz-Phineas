## About
This project is for a school assessment.

Recollect is a memory and cognitive skill trainer.

Match tiles with numerous difficulty levels. <br>
Create an account and get a rating based on your performance. <br>
Scores and data saves into your account through a local JSON file. (*nothing fancy i know*) <br>
Change the appearance of the program through multiple themes in the options menu.

The code is written and designed for simple implementation of new code and parts of the program.


## Download and Installation
* [Download the repository](https://github.com/Bsisou/gui-quiz-Phineas/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

* Find the downloaded ZIP file and right-click on it. Select "Extract All..." and choose an empty folder to extract it to. Ensure no external files are in the working directory.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you extracted the files.
*You can do this by running the command `cd [path-to-folder]`, replacing `[path-to-folder]` with your actual path to the folder.*

* Install the required dependencies by running the following pip command in the terminal:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
*I cannot confirm that the program will run as intended using installations of previous or newer versions of packages. Install through the above command to ensure the program works as expected.*

* Once the installation is complete, run ```main.py``` with Python 3.8 or above using the command:
```python main.py```
