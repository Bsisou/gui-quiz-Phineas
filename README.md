## About
This project is for a school assessment. (*i may have done too much...*)

Recollect is a memory and cognitive skill trainer.

Match tiles with numerous difficulty levels. <br>
Create an account and get a rating based on your performance. <br>
Scores and data saves into your account through a local JSON file. (*nothing fancy i know*) <br>
Change the appearance of the program through multiple themes in the options menu.

The code is written and designed for simple implementation of new code and parts of the program.
<br><br>

## Download and Installation
* [Download the repository](https://github.com/Bsisou/gui-quiz-Phineas/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). 

* Find the downloaded ZIP file and right-click on it. Select "Extract All..." and choose an empty folder to extract it to. Ensure no external files are in the working directory.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the where you extracted the main.py file.<br>
*On Windows 11, you can right-click on the location of the download and click `Open in Terminal`*<br>
*Otherwise, ou can do this by running the command `cd "[path-to-folder]"`, replacing `[path-to-folder]` with your actual path to the folder.*

* Install the required dependencies by running the following pip command in the terminal:<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
*Ensure you have pip installed on your device*<br>
*I cannot confirm that the program will run as intended using installations of previous or newer versions of packages. Install through the above command to ensure the program works as expected.*

* Once the installation is complete, run ```main.py``` with Python 3.8 or above using the command:<br>
```python main.py``` or ```python3.8 main.py```<br>
*Opening the main.py file through file explorer may cause some issues to arise and I cannot confirm the program will run as intend this way.*
